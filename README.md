# README

This application helps manage ADN sequences and detect with them mutant
substrings. A human sample is a mutant when there are more than one mutant
pattern found.

The repo follows as much of the Rails conventions as possible, so should be
pretty straightforward to run.

## TODO

- Add React as requested
- Configure deployment
